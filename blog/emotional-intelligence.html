            Emotional Intelligence is the capacity for a person to be aware of and manage the emotional state of themselves and others and the ability to apply this 
            ability to solve problems in a social context. While testing for EQ is not as standardised for IQ it is largely recognised that EQ can be learnt and improved.
          </p>
          <p>
            So why is EQ so important? Having a higher EQ has been increasingly been attributed greater to success in life over the years and goes beyond simply being 
            charismatic or having good interpersonal skills to use in the workplace (though it does touch on that aspect as well). EQ also deals with awareness and regulation 
            of emotion in youself which means improving EQ can improve your ability to manage negative emotions (doubt, anger, sadness) but also helps with motivation. 
            Being able to see this in others however also allows for increased empathy and relationship management. Being able to use these to problem solve in a social 
            context enables you to improve in teamwork, leadership, team management and customer/client service. While academic grades might be more commonly attributed to 
            IQ it has been found that high EQ also results in higher grades, attendence and less discipline measures likely as a result of higher motivation and 
            interpersonal skills.
          </p>
          <p>
            So how do we improve our EQ if it's so important? Since EQ largely comprises of various skills it's basically the same way we improve in other skills. 
            To become aware of emotions in ourselves we must be able to analyse our own emotional state so we can determine which emotion is which and what effects it 
            causes in us. This allows us to develop our self-understanding and so we become able to label emotions as they arise. EQ also comprises self-regulation of 
            emotion so the skill of being able to choose a response when we recognise an emotion. The most common type of emotion we often see needing regulation is anger 
            so in that case one must become aware of what triggers this emotion, how to identify it and how to manage our reaction to it. Both skills can be extended to 
            other people (our awareness of what they are feeling and our ability to react to it) and then the interpersonal skills involved in helping others to regulate 
            those emotions.
