          <p><h3 class="questions">What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3></p>
          <p>Generally speaking I am working towards a developer role but as of yet am unsure of the specifics. Some of these I am hoping that my experience 
            with DevAcademy can help me decide as I have had periods of working with tight, regular schedules and looser more flexible ones. I have had good and 
            bad experiences when working with and without a team as well. I also have far more experience with Java, C++ and Python than I do with HTML, CSS & 
            JavaScript so web development was not one of the areas I looked when I had just graduated.</p>
          <p><h3 class="questions">A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning.</h3></p>
          <p>I believe I am relatively resilient when it comes to learning. I know well how frustrating programming can be when you have both limited time and 
            are running out of ideas and have had to power on through regardless.</p>
          <p>I tend to work in long blocks though if I believe I'm still working on one continuous task (I once worked for 16 hours straight on a project overnight 
            with barely a thought for even eating) and dislike taking short breaks if it's going well (since it disturbs my train of thought). This can lead to 
            burnout or disorganisation and sometimes, if I get tired during the work, I might theoretically be less productive. Of course as projects became more 
            complex and difficult it became more likely I could/had to break up these tasks.</p>
          <p><h3 class="questions">What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy? </h3></p>
          <p>Of course, as my goal at the end of this program is to find work, I want to learn the skills involved with jobseeking (selling yourself, interview skills etc)
             but also build on my ability to learn and pick up skills. They say to get into development you have to keep learning for life so being able to keep myself
              up-to-date with industry standards afterwards is also important.</p>
          <p><h3 class="questions">A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</h3></p>
          <p>As I have a propensity to do too much at once or leave things too late I have endeavored to use the time boxes to pace myself and make sure I have
             enough time but also to spread things out so I don't burn myself out unnecessarily. While prioritising making sure I learn all the material I need 
             I will also try to make sure I learn to balance my work carefully to keep myself productive.</p>
          <p><h3 class="questions">A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</h3></p>
          <p>I will seek help from my facilitator, home group and/or other students for any queries I may have on the discord as is appropriate.
             I will attempt to identify potential issues I may need help with in my planning step and ask early that way I can be sure my plan can also meet the 
             time restraints on the project.</p>
          <p><h3 class="questions">A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team.</h3></p>
          <p>I only really require the facilitators to help me with any practical problems that come up. In particular as a learner it's common that things will 
            come up that are completely unknown to me and that I may not not even think of asking about (unknown unknowns) so I hope facilitators can keep that in 
            mind if I'm asking about something and may not be asking the right questions (ie I ask about doing a task one way when there is a much simpler/better 
            practice way to do the task that I may not be aware of).</p>
          <p><h3 class="questions">Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things.</h3></p>
          <p>As far as I am aware of I have no block-out times (other than sleeping so hopefully 4am lessons aren't about to be announced). If serious comes up or 
            changes in this regard I will be sure to let the facilitation team know.</p>
