          </p>
          <p>
            I'm not sure if it counts as blocked per se but I was a bit confused when doing the last part of the JS-Olympics. At first I thought there was probably some method or
            some cleaner way of making a new object from a function that I didn't know of so I did a quick google search and found constructors. Assuming this was a way I could
            do the last part I wrote a constructor and failed the test. At first I thought my problem was the syntax (which I then double checked) but upon inspection of the 
            test fail message "make sure we get an Object back" I started to think a constructor wasn't the solution since it wouldn't return an object. I then looked at the 
            tests to see how the new object was being made which confirmed I was on the wrong track. I then pieced together that I just had to take the parameters and return them
            as an object.
          </p>

            <h3 class="questions">A time I solved a simple problem</h3>
          </p>
          <p>
            The FizzBuzz (Super Edition) was perhaps the cleanest example of problem solving since I largely managed to solve it while reading the question. I tend to find it
            useful to first breakdown the problem before starting (if you can do it then you can proceed and if not you know what you need to look up now or later on). The FizzBuzz
            problem and my break down was as follows:
          </p>
          <div>
            <img src="../images/paragraph-fizzbuzz-1.JPG" alt="Paragraph Fizzbuzz 1" class="paragraph-example-image">
          </div>
          <p>
            This translated to me as "I need a function with a number parameter and some conditionals".
          </p>
          <div>
            <img src="../images/paragraph-fizzbuzz-2.JPG" alt="Paragraph Fizzbuzz 2" class="paragraph-example-image">
          </div>
          <p>
            This translated vaguely to "My conditons are parameter % X === 0 and else will be to just return the number"
          </p>
          <div>
            <img src="../images/paragraph-fizzbuzz-3.JPG" alt="Paragraph Fizzbuzz 3" class="paragraph-example-image">
          </div>
          <p>
            "So I just need to iterate over the array, call my fizzbuzz function on each element and return the modified array".
          </p>
          <p>
            There were a few hiccups with syntax and refactoring the code after but for simple problems I try to reach this stage before doing much else. 
          </p>
          <div>
            <ul><h3 class="questions">Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes:</h3></ul>
              <li class="questions">Pseudocode</li>
              <p>
                I have basically never used pseudocode though I can see its use once you have more complex functions and/or have to plan out multiple functions. 
                I mostly do this in my head so it really depends if the scope is big enough that I can't remember everything. I also tend to focus on one function at a time so
                that further limits how often I end up doing this. I can definitely remember some times when I probably should have done this though.
              </p>
              <li class="questions">Trying something</li>
              <p>
                This step almost always happens at some point. Unless I'm utterly unsure what I'm supposed to do I always like to try writing what I know and seeing what I get
                and troubleshooting from there.
              </p>
              <li class="questions">Rubber ducky method</li>
              <p>
                I do a pseudo version of this step very early on in my troubleshooting. I tend to look through my code and think through it or if it looks right then re-analyse the
                problem and see if I'm understanding it correctly. I'm no stranger to talking to myself about the problem but this usually fails to solve the real issue I would
                come up against if I get to this stage since it usually means I've made an incorrect assumption and just gloss over that part again. As a result this usually ties 
                in with just asking for help if I involve other people.
              </p>
              <li class="questions">Reading error messages</li>
              <p>
                IDE's are very useful in catching typos and syntax errors so I use this all the time. When it becomes a more complex problem I have probably glossed over error
                messages a lot though. Copying and pasting the error message onto google has not been one of my go-to methods.
              </p>
              <li class="questions">Console.logging</li>
              <p>
                Something I do quite often if I'm writing code I know is incomplete but want visual feedback to check what I have written. Useful for checking things like if your
                loops, conditionals or other small pieces of code are working or what they actually doing each loop.
              </p>
              <li class="questions">Googling</li>
              <p>
                At times I have been a bit reluctant to using this as a solution. Especially since in CompSci the answers are often some overlooked bit from your lectures or 
                tutorials and they tend to be very specific about how you should be solving a problem. I'm fairly confident otherwise though since I commonly use this for 
                troubleshooting technical issues or whenever I need to really. 
              </p>
              <li class="questions">Asking your peers for help</li>
              <p>
                I have a few peers who are in the tech industry (none of them are web developers though) and I've always been more comfortable asking them for help. Sadly this has not
                historically been a particularly useful option for many reasons...This is kind of murky though given my answer below.
              </p>
              <li class="questions">Asking coaches for help</li>
              <p>
                I don't think I've asked my lecturers for help in my life since they can be notoriously hard to get ahold of for a quick response, have limited time etc. The people
                who do the tutorials are students though and I used their help quite a bit when things got rough in the 3rd year. I got better at asking for help as a result and 
                it really saved me a lot of trouble when I've been truly stuck.
              </p>
              <li class="questions">Improving your process with reflection</li>
              <p>
                I'm not sure I've ever reflected in written form like this on many aspects. However over my time coding I've pretty much tried all of these in some kind of way so
                I have slowly gotten a general sense of what has worked for me and what has not and what order to try these.
