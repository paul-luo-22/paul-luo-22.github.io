              <li class="questions">Pseudocode</li>
              <p>
                I have basically never used pseudocode though I can see its use once you have more complex functions and/or have to plan out multiple functions. 
                I mostly do this in my head so it really depends if the scope is big enough that I can't remember everything. I also tend to focus on one function at a time so
                that further limits how often I end up doing this. I can definitely remember some times when I probably should have done this though.
              </p>
              <li class="questions">Trying something</li>
              <p>
                This step almost always happens at some point. Unless I'm utterly unsure what I'm supposed to do I always like to try writing what I know and seeing what I get
                and troubleshooting from there. That being said there's definitely been occasions when I've been too eager to get something done and should've planned a bit 
                more or read the question better...
              </p>
              <li class="questions">Rubber ducky method</li>
              <p>
                I do a pseudo version of this step very early on in my troubleshooting. I tend to look through my code and think through it or if it looks right then reanalyse the
                problem and see if I'm understanding it correctly. I'm no stranger to talking to myself about the problem but this usually fails to solve the real issue I would
                come up against if I get to this stage since it usually means I've made an incorrect assumption and just gloss over that part again. As a result this usually ties 
                in with just asking for help.
              </p>
              <li class="questions">Reading error messages</li>
              <p>
                IDE's are very useful in catching typos and syntax errors so I use this all the time. When it becomes a more complex problem I have probably glossed over error
                messages a lot though. Copying and pasting the error message onto google has not been one of my go-to methods.
              </p>
              <li class="questions">Console.logging</li>
              <p>
                Something I do quite often if I'm writing code I know if incomplete but want visual feedback to check what I have written. Useful for checking things like if your
                loops, conditionals or other small pieces of code are working or what they actually doing each loop.
              </p>
              <li class="questions">Googling</li>
              <p>
                At times I have been a bit reluctant to using this as a solution. Especially since in CompSci the answers are often some overlooked bit from your lectures or 
                tutorials and they tend to be very specific about how you should be solving a problem. I'm fairly confident otherwise though since I commonly use this for 
                troubleshooting technical issues or whenever I need to really. 
              </p>
              <li class="questions">Asking your peers for help</li>
              <p>
                I have a few peers who are in the tech industry (none of them are web developers though) and I've always been more comfortable asking them for help. Sadly this has not
                historically been a particularly useful option for many reasons...This is kind of murky though given my answer below.
              </p>
              <li class="questions">Asking coaches for help</li>
              <p>
                I don't think I've asked my lecturers for help in my life since they can be notoriously hard to get ahold of for a quick response, have limited time etc. The people
                who do the tutorials are students though and I used their help quite a bit when things got rough in the 3rd year. I got better at asking for help as a result and 
                it really saved me a lot of trouble when I've been truly stuck.
              </p>
              <li class="questions">Improving your process with reflection</li>
              <p>
                I'm not sure I've ever reflected in written form like this on many aspects. However over my time coding I've pretty much tried all of these in some kind of way so
                I have slowly gotten a sense of what has worked for me and what has not and a general sense of what order to try these.
