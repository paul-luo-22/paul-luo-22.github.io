            Neuroplasticity is the ability for the brain to change by forming new neural connections in response to experience. While this is also useful for compensating for
            injuries (functional plasticity) the usefulness in our case is that it shows a capacity for our brains to learn and change structure from experience even as we age
            (structural plasticity). It works by the brain eliminating or strengthening neural connections through repeated experience which is called synaptic pruning. If we
            experience something frequently the synapses that fire as a result of that experience will form stronger connections while if they become infrequent then those
            connections are eventually lost. For learning then it comes down to practice and the ability to think of something in various ways. As we repeat tasks the brain
            will naturally be able to retrive the information we need for that task more and more quickly.

            A growth mindset is the belief that your abilities, such as intelligence or creativity, are malleable traits that we can develop. In contrast a fixed mindset is
            the belief that these abilities are fixed quantities so someone with fixed mindset will move from thinking how to improve at something and instead think how they can
            use what they have. A key factor in growth mindset then is how one thinks about challenges and failures. For someone with fixed mindset a failure is just that, a demonstration
            of their lack of ability, and thus challenges are to be met with trepidation. For growth mindset one needs to be aware that failure can be transient, it is something that
            can be overcome with time and practice (when one has grown), and becomes an opportunity to learn. Challenges are therefore to be met with the resolve to fail and further
            develop ones abilities.

            Like many, I imgaine, I find myself being fixed in some areas and growth in others. I have always believed in talent as a seperator between people's abilities but I also
            firmly believe that people can become able enough to do anything anyone else can with enough practice. In that way up to 99% of someone's ability could be solely down 
            to their efforts. I also find myself often evaluating my own abilities in critical ways such as my own ability at maths is pretty low. In this way it could be a 
            problem with having a fixed mindset on my skills in maths and I also tend to avoid advanced mathematics. That being said when it came time to take math-heavy papers in
            order to take further coding papers I used my evaluations to focus on growing that skill (ie I knew my abilities weren't enough to pass so I needed to put in even more
            effort to succeed). So while I am mindful of my weaknesses and, in some cases (since I don't believe even my skill in coding is a particular strength), don't particularly
            try to change that I am still aware that if I wanted to and really put in the effort I can become very skilled at a subject that was formerly one of my weakpoints.
