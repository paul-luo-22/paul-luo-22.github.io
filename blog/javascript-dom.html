            <h3 class="questions">What is Javascript?</h3>
          </p>
          <p>
            Javascript is used to add responsiveness or interaction to a webpage. That is it allows elements on a page to be manipulated based on input such as a user 
            clicking on something. You can think of HTML, CSS and JS as being akin to a crane game; without being able to interact with it it would simply be some 
            plushies in a glass display. The controls you interact with might be part of the display but without JS the controls don't allow you to interact with what's 
            within so JS, in this case, would be the electronic and mechanical components that will move the claw in accordance to user input.</p>
          <p><h3 class="questions">Control Flow and Loops</h3>
          </p>
          <p>
            Control flow is simply the order the computer will run code and typically, without any loops or functions, runs from top to the bottom of your code. 
            Loops then can change this flow since the computer will run the code in the loop possibly multiple times until a condition is met (that is it may go back to 
            the code at the top of the loop and run it again).
          </p>
          <p>
            <h3 class="questions">The DOM</h3>
          </p>
          <p>
            The DOM is short for Document Object Model and is a representation of a web document as a series of nodes and objects. The DOM breaks down the page in such a 
            way that allows a programming language (Javascript) to interact and manipulate elements. In the example bleow we are able to obtain a list of nodes that use the 
            paragraph tag using .querySelectorAll which could allow us to use JS to manipulate all paragraphs (such as changing the color).

            <h3 class="questions">Arrays and Objects</h3>
          </p>
          <p>
            Arrays are basically lists of variables that may or may not be related to each other. Items within the array may be reached through their index (starting 
            from 0 for the first item in the list). We can use this by using a for loop to reach every item of the array by looping through its the array by the items index. 
            In the example below we print the 3rd item in an array (the index of the array are 0,1,2) and then print each item by incrementing i from 0 to 2 and repeating the 
            loop with every increment.
          </p>

          </div>
          <p>
            Objects however are a list of property pairs that typically relate to an object. For instance with a dog object we might say it has 4 legs. That 4 leggedness 
            is a property with a name such as number of legs and a value which would be 4 which belongs to the dog object. We may interact with these properties within the 
            object by using propertyName.propertyValue to get the value and to change it though let's use a less gruesome example in this case.

            <h3 class="questions">Functions</h3>
          </p>
          <p>
            Functions are a section of code used to perform a set task. This is useful since if you want to repeat the task you can simply call on the function instead of 
            repeating this code. Functions may also accept parameter(s) which is can accept from another area in the program to manipulate/sort and return. In the example 
            below I write a basic function which simply appends an exclamation mark to the end of a word. When called it takes a word as its parameter, appends an exclamation
             mark and returns this combined item.
