            <h3 class="questions">Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make.</h3>
          </p>
          <p>
            I really struggle to think of any ethical decision of any real importance that I have had to make. In fact the only thing(s) that really comes up is something 
            ridiculously trivial. A long time ago I remember finding $50 by the roadside while walking home with a friend from school. We had a brief conversation on if I should
            return it and, deciding that I should, but seeing no one around...I slotted it into the nearby mailbox. I have no idea what this says about me ethically
            but I can't really recall anything besides other trivialities.

            <h3 class="questions">Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity. </h3>
          </p>
          <p>
            While I was born in China most of my upbringing was here in NZ. In that way no doubt being of both countries affected how I grew up. 
            Chinese culture places a heavy emphasis on family and NZ is multicultural with values of fairness and open-mindedness. While I value all those things 
            I do think that I tend to not let what national values or cultural values to influence my own. In many ways people tend more to think of me as really 
            being from NZ or China so perhaps it's more influenced how people perceive me than my own perception of myself. Of course I also appreciate the cultures 
            I am a part of but I would rather let my actions and reason define me.</p>
          <p><h3 class="questions">Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development</h3>
          </p>
          <p>
            I believe I have decent resilience given how the situation below turned out (it got worse) and somehow managing to learn and comeback from it. 
            In my university days I have had to code with all the stress and time pressure that can involve so I am no stranger to that side of things (apparently 
            I had a rare combination of papers too so I sometimes had rather strict deadlines). Given my experience with that I completely understand why so much of 
            our learning had included things such as motivations, keeping organised and dealing with stress since it can be very easy to get frustrated when getting 
            stuck. I think in this case that kind of experience my own knowledge of my methodology for when I encounter those situations can be a strength too.
            I am rather reserved however and find it hard to sell myself to prospective employers (ITSP on the Myers Briggs test) and that has been a source of trouble
            for me in my job search. I hope that what I learn at DevAcademy can also go someway to give myself a portfolio that will be useful in showing to employers. 
            I can also be rather disorganised and can be slow to start and stop projects.

            Without sharing too much since this is public I once had a group project during one of my papers. During my first meeting with the rest of the group we had 
            planned out and divided the workload amongst the group. As far as I knew, especially given that everyone seemed pretty open with pitching ideas during the 
            design phase, everyone was perfectly happy with the arrangements made that day. That is until the results for the project came out and it turned out every 
            other member in the project said I had done too little of the work and so I was heavily penalised (basically 0 for the whole project). Of course I was 
            crushed since none of this was communicated to me beforehand and I was more than willing to pick up more of the work if they had told me. The aftermath and
            what I did/learnt afterwards makes this an even longer story but needless to say this example at least was a bitter one.
