            <h3 class="questions">What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h3>
          </p>
          <p>
            I've actually reflected a lot over the years but how I think of myself seems very different from how others seem to form their self-identity. Things like culture or values
            don't really seem to weigh that heavily for me (I like/value kindness but I also like/value chocolate. Am I chocolate?). I think we have to be able to rationalise what 
            we think of ourselves.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I first heard about fixed mindset (during the intro video) I thought that would definitely be me (especially since that maths example is basically what I think 
            of myself at maths). Surprisingly I have more growth mindset about some things than I'd thought.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have a habit of tensing my jaw a lot unconciously that I didn't notice so much before having to do meditations.

            <h3 class="questions">What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
          </p>
          <p>
            Having empathy and being self-aware allows you to develop awareness of your own emotions, strengths and weaknesses which you can use to improve yourself or use to
            help you work well with others.
          </p>

            <h3 class="questions">What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
          </p>
          <p>
            There were a lot of times this part felt harder than the tech section.
          </p>
          <p>
            <h3 class="questions">What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
          </p>
          <p>
            Compared to the tech side a lot of the problem solving methods don't really work. It's not like you can google your values (although maybe google knows them
            better than you at this point). A lot of the time I'm trying to search for a right answer even though there is no right answer but the answer I have doesn't feel
            quite right either.
          </p>
          <p>
            <h3 class="questions">Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h3>
          </p>
          <p>
            People in the industry told you that they value social skills in applicants?
          </p>
          <p>
            <h3 class="questions">Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
          </p>
          <p>
            I wouldn't say it feels like a waste of time but it's hard to say how effective it is since it's difficult to measure the skills in core learning to begin with. 
            A lot of programming can be rote learned but it's hard to say that is the case for social skills or self-awareness.
